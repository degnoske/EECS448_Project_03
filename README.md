#####Product Vision:
>- Track your productivity and stay on top of your goals.
- Constantly reminded to self-care and to avoid Internet distractions. 

> Those are the vision of the developers of Slacker Hacker. Slacker Hacker is a productivity tracking application for Chrome. When embedded in your web browser as an Chrome extension, it turns the new tab into a web application with various functionalities. 
We are inspired by the idea that while working productively, ones should be reminded constantly to self-care. This leads to a healthier and even more effective work routine. 

####Set up:
1. Download *studytracker* package to your local device
2. Load the package as an extension in your Chrome browser
3. Don't be a slacker

*More information about setting up the app can be found in the [user manual](https://github.com/degnoske/EECS448_Project_03/blob/master/studytracker/documentation/SlackerHackerUserManual.pdf)*
